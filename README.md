# Project Title: GearShare

## Project Description
This project involves the design and development of a web-based software application using software engineering management principles and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. The project is to be completed in teams of 3, and the application must be approved by the instructor. The scope should be small-to-medium to be completed within approximately 2 months.

### Example Application Ideas:
- Employee scheduler for organizations
- Asset management tool for tracking equipment purchases
- Exercise tracker and learning management system
- Movie/music/media information database (similar to IMDB)

## Design and Architecture
The project follows the structured engineering design process and utilizes the MVC architecture, which includes:
- **Model**: Database for data storage and management.
- **View**: User interfaces for interacting with the application.
- **Controller**: Handles interactions and updates between the model and the view.

### Design Constraints
Your solution should consider at least four of the following design constraints:
- **Economic factors**
- **Regulatory compliance** (Security and Access)
- **Reliability**
- **Sustainability and Environmental Factors**
- **Ethics**
- **Societal Impacts**

## Teamwork and Collaboration
The project emphasizes teamwork, including team formation, time management, and conflict resolution. Regular meetings will be held to monitor progress, and contributions should be regularly committed to GitHub.

## Presentation Requirements
The project must be hosted on GitHub and include:
- A `REPORT.md` file with detailed usage instructions and project description.
- Well-commented code.
- Public access to your GitHub project for the duration of ENSE 374 and beyond (optional).

## Project Deliverables
1. **Functional Prototype**: A working version of the software.
2. **Technical Report (`REPORT.md`)**: Detailed documentation following the provided template.
3. **Oral Presentation**: Present your project according to the provided format.
